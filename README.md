After Dana was provided with the information on a Json format, we decide to organize our work environment with the folders and the data in a way that makes it easier to work in order.

This is the result of 3 phases: 

### FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES
We started with the app file creating variables and functions that help us iterating the data in order to filter it 

### HTML INDEX
We brought it to life with json creating a webpage easy to browser with all the info that we collect and the option to filter it by 5 different criteria 

### CSS
In this file we store the image and the colors that we wanted to use on the website
